I am a PhD student in the [ECEO Lab at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/), supervised by [Prof. Devis Tuia](https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia). My research develops AI and remote sensing tools for humanitarian applications. In collaboration with [ETH Zurich](https://css.ethz.ch/en/) and the [International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)](https://www.icrc.org/en), I work on AI-driven methods for crisis analysis, including using nighttime lights to monitor and understand human activity in crisis-affected regions.

I hold an integrated Masterâ€™s degree in Informatics from the University of Edinburgh, where I worked on AI for biodiversity monitoring and species distribution modeling under the supervision of [Prof. Oisin Mac Aodha](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/omacaod/).
